Popular game where you have to connect 3 balls of one color (or 5 in hard mode)
If you fail to do that in 1 move then 3 additional balls spawn at random positions.

If the whole map is filled the game is lost.

Each erased ball grants 1 point.

Just click Kulki.html to play.

//All you really need are "dist" and "grafiki" folders and Kulki.html, queue.js and script.js files to play the game, the rest are just ts/webpack sources

//Game deffinitly runs on Chrome and Firefox, I'm not sure about other browsers.
